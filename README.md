# learningpython
Practice exercises and problem solution using python programming language. 
As the name goes "learningpython", most concepts/idea in this repository are not originally from me.
Since I am learning from online courses, books and blogs, I mostly base my code to the exercises/examples from those sources.

Some snippets may have exact code from sources, but there should be no exact copy pasted file here 
for I have coded every file in this repository as I am trying to understand concepts and try to add/explore more functionalities.

The content of this repository are:
 - my own version of exercise files based on practice exercises at teamtreehouse.com.
 - (upcoming) programs/appliations conceptualized by others (based on udemy/lynda courses)but built by me 
 
 References should be seen commented on each file/project.
